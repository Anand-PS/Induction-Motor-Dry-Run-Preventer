# Induction-Motor-Dry-Run-Preventer

This is a device built for the protection of Induction motor.

It uses,
- ACS712 20A
- Arduino Nano
as the main components

By measuring the current from the sensor the system decides whether
the motor is running with no load and then it switches off the motor
after the delay set by using the pot provided.

The threshold of current can also be set by the provided potentiometer.

Thus the induction motor is protected!
